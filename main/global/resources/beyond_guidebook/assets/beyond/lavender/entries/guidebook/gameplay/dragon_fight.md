The Ender Dragon fight has also been updated. 


With limesplatus' {#800080}True Ending{} the fight is significantly more challenging.


{#FF0000}This fight is no joke!{}

<|item-spotlight@lavender:book_components|item=minecraft:dragon_head|>

The fight has been split into multiple phases and there are multiple new devastating attacks. 


It is a good idea to bring lots of supplies, as the fight is longer than usual. I would also recommend to set a spawn point before you enter the end portal.
