To make the game more challanging, 16 unique types of ender pearl have been added. 


Placing the classic ender eye on the portal doesn't work anymore, instead you need to collect {#1A5FB4}12 different{} eyes to activate the portal.


To learn more about how to find them search {#1A5FB4}Ender Eyes{} in EMI.
